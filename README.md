# go-scheduling

A hands-on scheduler project for mastering Go's concurrency features

## Description

This project was developed as a self-learning exercise to deepen my understanding of Go's powerful concurrency model, including goroutines, channels, and sync primitives.  
It provides a simple yet extensible scheduler that executes tasks concurrently, manages their lifecycle, and ensures graceful shutdown.

## Key Features

- Concurrent task execution using goroutines
- Safe task management with channels and sync.WaitGroup
- Graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
- Extensible and maintainable code structure

## Why this project?

I designed and implemented this scheduler to strengthen my practical skills in Go, focusing on writing robust, readable, and production-ready concurrent code.  
It serves as both a learning resource and a demonstration of my technical growth in Go.
